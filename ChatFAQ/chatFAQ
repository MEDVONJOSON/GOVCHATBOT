Q19: What challenges influenced the creation of Sierra Leone’s Cybersecurity Policy?

Expanded Answer:
Sierra Leone faced a rapidly growing digital ecosystem with increasing cyber threats targeting government systems, financial institutions, telecoms, and personal data. The country lacked a unified legal and institutional framework to address cyberattacks, cyber fraud, online child exploitation, and digital privacy concerns. Additionally, national infrastructure was exposed due to limited cyber awareness, weak technical capacity, and outdated regulations. These challenges highlighted the urgent need for a comprehensive national policy that strengthens governance, protects citizens, and aligns the country with international cyber norms.

Q20: What global trends impact Sierra Leone’s cybersecurity landscape?

Expanded Answer:
The global rise in sophisticated cyberattacks—such as ransomware, phishing, identity theft, cyber espionage, and attacks against critical infrastructure—affects Sierra Leone directly and indirectly. The increasing use of cloud services, mobile banking, IoT devices, and social media also introduces new risks. Sierra Leone must adapt because cybercriminals do not need to be physically present; attacks can originate globally but target local financial systems, government portals, and citizens. International digital growth demands new national defenses, prompting Sierra Leone to strengthen regulations.

Q21: What regional efforts support Sierra Leone's cybersecurity development?

Expanded Answer:
The African Union’s Malabo Convention provides guidance to African states on harmonizing laws related to cybersecurity, electronic transactions, and data protection. Sierra Leone uses this convention as a benchmark to improve legislation, promote cross-border cooperation, and ensure security in West Africa’s digital markets. Regional bodies such as ECOWAS also support threat intelligence sharing and capacity building. These efforts help Sierra Leone build a resilient cyber environment and strengthen its contribution to continental digital security.

Q22: What local assessments helped shape the national policy?

Expanded Answer:
Two major national assessments shaped the policy:

The 2016 Cybersecurity Maturity Model Assessment, which evaluated national readiness, governance, legislation, and institutional capability.
